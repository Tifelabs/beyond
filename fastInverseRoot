I’ll help you write the famous fast inverse square root algorithm in C++! This is the legendary algorithm from Quake III Arena.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

float fastInverseSqrt(float number) {
    long i;
    float x2, y;
    const float threehalfs = 1.5F;

    x2 = number * 0.5F;
    y = number;
    i = * ( long * ) &y;                       // evil floating point bit level hacking
    i = 0x5f3759df - ( i >> 1 );               // what the fuck? (original comment)
    y = * ( float * ) &i;
    y = y * ( threehalfs - ( x2 * y * y ) );   // 1st iteration of Newton-Raphson
    // y = y * ( threehalfs - ( x2 * y * y ) );   // 2nd iteration, can be removed
    
    return y;
}

int main() {
    float number = 4.0f;
    
    // Fast inverse square root
    float fastResult = fastInverseSqrt(number);
    
    // Standard calculation for comparison
    float standardResult = 1.0f / std::sqrt(number);
    
    std::cout << "Number: " << number << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Fast inverse sqrt: " << fastResult << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Standard 1/sqrt(): " << standardResult << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Error: " << std::abs(fastResult - standardResult) << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

**Key points about this algorithm:**

1. **The Magic Number** (`0x5f3759df`): This constant is used for the initial approximation through bit manipulation
1. **Bit-level Hacking**: It reinterprets the float as an integer to manipulate its bits directly
1. **Newton-Raphson Iteration**: One iteration refines the approximation for better accuracy
1. **Speed vs Accuracy**: It’s faster than `1.0f / std::sqrt(x)` but less accurate

**Modern Note**: On modern CPUs with SSE instructions, the standard library’s `1.0f / std::sqrt(x)` is often just as fast or faster, and more accurate. But this algorithm remains famous for its cleverness!

If you want to use it in production code today, you might want to add a second Newton-Raphson iteration (uncomment that line) for better accuracy.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
